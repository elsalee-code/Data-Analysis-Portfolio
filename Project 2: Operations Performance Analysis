## Project 2: Operations Performance Analysis

### Objective
To analyze operational data in order to identify performance inefficiencies and key factors contributing to delays.

### Dataset
## Key Questions
1. What is the typical average delivery time across all orders?
2. Which regions or operational categories perform worse than the overall average?
3. How do delivery times vary based on order characteristics (e.g. vehicle type, age, time delivered)?
4. What operational improvements could reduce recurring delays?
